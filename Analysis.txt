The number of users increased year over year from 2013 to 2017. This is probably because more awareness was raised among the public of the impacts that carbon emmissions have on global warming and climate change. The cost of fossil fuels may have contributed to this trend as well.

The number of subscribers increased year over year, signifying that the trend of biking as a means of regular transporation and daily commute is on the rise.
